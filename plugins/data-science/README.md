# Data Science

Evaluation dataset creation, data specification generation, Jupyter notebooks, and Streamlit dashboards

> [!CAUTION]
> This collection includes RAI (Responsible AI) agents and prompts that are **assistive tools only**. They do not replace qualified responsible AI review, ethics board oversight, or established organizational RAI governance processes. All AI-generated RAI assessments, impact analyses, and recommendations **must** be reviewed and validated by qualified professionals before use. AI outputs may contain inaccuracies, miss critical risk categories, or produce recommendations that are incomplete or inappropriate for your context.

## Overview

Generate data specifications, Jupyter notebooks, and Streamlit dashboards from natural language descriptions. Evaluate AI-powered data systems against Responsible AI standards. This collection includes specialized agents for data science workflows in Python and RAI assessment.
