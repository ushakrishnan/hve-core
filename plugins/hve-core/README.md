# HVE Core Workflow

HVE Core RPI (Research, Plan, Implement, Review) workflow with Git commit, merge, setup, and pull request prompts

## Overview

HVE Core provides the flagship RPI (Research, Plan, Implement, Review) workflow for completing complex tasks through a structured four-phase process. The RPI workflow dispatches specialized agents that collaborate autonomously to deliver well-researched, planned, and validated implementations. This collection also includes Git workflow prompts for commit messages, merge operations, repository setup, and pull request management.
