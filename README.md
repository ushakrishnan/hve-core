HVE Core helps teams ship faster with GitHub Copilot by combining specialized agents, reusable prompts, coding instructions, and validated skills into one workflow system.

Use HVE Core when you want AI-assisted work to be repeatable, standards-aligned, and scalable across individuals and teams. HVE Core provides structured AI workflow building blocks:

* Agents for specialized tasks such as research, planning, implementation, and review
* Prompts for repeatable workflow entry points
* Instructions that apply coding standards automatically
* Skills that add reusable tool capabilities

## Where to Start

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
[![Install HVE Core - Essentials Collection](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS%20Code-Install%20Core%20Collection-007ACC?logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ise-hve-essentials.hve-core)
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

1. Install the [HVE Core extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ise-hve-essentials.hve-core) from the VS Code Marketplace.
2. Open any project and launch GitHub Copilot Chat (`Ctrl+Alt+I`).
3. Select an agent from the picker (try **rpi-agent**, **task-researcher**, or **memory**) and start a conversation.

> [!TIP]
> Use [HVE Core All Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ise-hve-essentials.hve-core-all) when you want the full collection deployment. See [Collections Overview](docs/getting-started/collections.md).
> [!TIP]
> Using GitHub Copilot CLI? Install as a plugin instead:
>
> ```bash
> copilot plugin marketplace add microsoft/hve-core
> copilot plugin install hve-core@hve-core
> ```
>
> See [CLI Plugins](docs/getting-started/methods/cli-plugins.md) for usage details.

## Label Management

Repository labels are declared in [`.github/labels.yml`](.github/labels.yml) and synced automatically by the [Label Sync](.github/workflows/label-sync.yml) workflow on push to `main` or via manual `workflow_dispatch`.

| Task               | How                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Add a label**    | Add an entry with `name`, `color` (bare hex, no `#`), and `description` to `.github/labels.yml`, then push to `main`                                                                                |
| **Update a label** | Edit the existing entry's `color` or `description`                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Rename a label** | Add an `aliases` array under the new canonical name listing the old name; the sync migrates existing assignments automatically                                                                      |
| **Delete a label** | Remove it manually in the [GitHub Labels UI](https://github.com/microsoft/hve-core/labels). Deleting an entry from the file does **not** delete it from GitHub (the workflow runs in additive mode) |
