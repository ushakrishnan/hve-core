# Objective 6 - Ensure Processes Do Not Rely on Memory

Objective 6 covers patterns that remove the burden of remembering information across screens, steps, or sessions. The user need is "Memory Support": users with cognitive and learning disabilities, working memory differences, or age-related decline are excluded by interfaces that expect them to memorise instructions, codes, or menu structures.

**Control 6.1 Ensure Processes Do Not Rely on Memory**

Multi-step processes must not require the user to remember information from earlier steps. Reference numbers, prior selections, and instructions should remain visible or be reproduced where needed.

**Design patterns**:

* Display reference numbers and prior selections persistently throughout multi-step processes.
* Reproduce relevant instructions on the screen where they are needed.
* Provide a summary of prior steps that remains accessible.
* Avoid asking users to memorise temporary codes between screens.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm information set in earlier steps remains visible when needed later.
* Confirm reference numbers and confirmation codes are persistently visible or saved.
* Confirm instructions are repeated on each screen where they apply.

**Control 6.2 Let Users Avoid Navigating Voice Menus**

Voice menus and interactive voice response trees impose heavy memory and attention demands. Users should have alternative contact methods (text chat, email, web form) so they can complete the task in a modality that suits them.

**Design patterns**:

* Provide alternative contact methods alongside any voice menu.
* Offer a direct route to a human agent.
* Provide a visible flat menu (text) as an alternative to voice trees.
* Allow callbacks rather than requiring users to wait on hold.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm voice menus are accompanied by web-based alternatives (chat, email, web form).
* Confirm users can reach a human without navigating a deep menu tree.
* Confirm callback options are offered for long wait times.

**Control 6.3 Do Not Rely on User Calculations or Memorising Information**

Users should never have to perform mental arithmetic or transcribe information across forms. Compute totals automatically and carry forward data the system already knows.

**Design patterns**:

* Calculate totals, tax, and similar derived values automatically.
* Pre-populate fields with information the system already holds.
* Show running totals and intermediate results clearly.
* Avoid asking users to copy or transcribe data the system can carry forward.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm derived values (totals, percentages, due dates) are computed automatically.
* Confirm known user information is pre-populated in subsequent forms.
* Confirm users are never asked to perform arithmetic the system can perform.
