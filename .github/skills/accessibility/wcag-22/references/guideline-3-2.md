# Guideline 3.2 — Predictable

Guideline 3.2 (Predictable) requires that web pages appear and operate in predictable ways, with consistent navigation and identification across the experience and no unexpected context changes.

## sc-3-2-1

**SC 3.2.1 On Focus (Level A)**

When any user-interface component receives focus, it does not initiate a change of context.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm receiving focus does not auto-submit forms, open new windows, or navigate to a new URL.
* Confirm focus on a dropdown does not open a menu unless the user explicitly opts in (then via Enter or arrow key, not focus alone).

## sc-3-2-2

**SC 3.2.2 On Input (Level A)**

Changing the setting of any user-interface component does not automatically cause a change of context unless the user has been advised of the behaviour before using the component.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm selecting an option in a dropdown does not auto-submit a form without prior warning.
* Confirm typing into a text field does not navigate away from the page.

## sc-3-2-3

**SC 3.2.3 Consistent Navigation (Level AA)**

Navigational mechanisms that are repeated on multiple pages occur in the same relative order each time, unless a change is initiated by the user.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm the main navigation appears in the same place and same order on every page of the site.

## sc-3-2-4

**SC 3.2.4 Consistent Identification (Level AA)**

Components that have the same functionality within a set of pages are identified consistently.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm "Search", "Submit", and other recurring controls use the same label and icon across the site.

## sc-3-2-5

**SC 3.2.5 Change on Request (Level AAA)**

Changes of context are initiated only by user request, or a mechanism is available to turn off such changes.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm automatic redirects, refresh, or modal pop-ups are user-initiated or can be disabled.

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#change-on-request>

## sc-3-2-6

**SC 3.2.6 Consistent Help (Level A)**

If a page includes a help mechanism (contact info, contact link, self-help, FAQ, or human contact mechanism), the help mechanism appears in the same relative order across the set of pages.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm help links or contact widgets appear in a consistent location across all pages where they exist.
