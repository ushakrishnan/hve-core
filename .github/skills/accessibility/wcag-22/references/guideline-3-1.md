**SC 3.1.1 Language of Page (Level A)**

The default human language of each web page can be programmatically determined.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm the root `<html>` element carries a `lang` attribute with a valid BCP 47 language tag.
* Confirm single-page applications set the language attribute to reflect the current content language when locale changes.

## sc-3-1-2

**SC 3.1.2 Language of Parts (Level AA)**

The human language of each passage or phrase in the content can be programmatically determined, except for proper names, technical terms, words of indeterminate language, and words or phrases that have become part of the surrounding text's vernacular.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm passages in a different language carry a `lang` attribute on the enclosing element.
* Confirm inline language switches (quotations, terms) use a `<span lang="...">`.

A mechanism is available for identifying specific pronunciation of words where pronunciation is essential to understanding meaning.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm homographs or pronunciation-sensitive terms include pronunciation hints (audio, IPA, or ruby annotation).
