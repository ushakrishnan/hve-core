# Guideline 2.5 — Input Modalities

Guideline 2.5 (Input Modalities) requires that users can operate functionality through various inputs beyond the keyboard, including pointer, touch, motion, and voice, with adequate target size and cancellation.

## sc-2-5-1

**SC 2.5.1 Pointer Gestures (Level A)**

All functionality that uses multipoint or path-based gestures can be operated with a single pointer without a path-based gesture, unless a multipoint or path-based gesture is essential.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm swipe, pinch, and rotate gestures have a single-tap or single-click alternative.
* Confirm path-based interactions (drag along a curve) have an equivalent tap-based path.

## sc-2-5-2

**SC 2.5.2 Pointer Cancellation (Level A)**

For functionality operated using a single pointer, at least one of the following is true: no down-event activates the function, the function completes on up-event and a mechanism is available to abort or undo, the up-event reverses the down-event, or completing on down-event is essential.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm clicks fire on pointerup or mouseup rather than on pointerdown for non-essential actions.
* Confirm dragging off a button before release cancels the activation.

## sc-2-5-3

**SC 2.5.3 Label in Name (Level A)**

For user-interface components with labels that include text or images of text, the accessible name contains the text that is presented visually.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm `aria-label` strings include the visible text exactly rather than rephrasing it.
* Confirm speech-input users can activate a control by saying its visible label.

## sc-2-5-4

**SC 2.5.4 Motion Actuation (Level A)**

Functionality that can be operated by device motion or user motion can also be operated by user-interface components, and response to motion can be disabled to prevent accidental actuation, except when motion is essential or the motion is used through an accessibility-supported interface.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm shake-to-undo and tilt-based controls have an on-screen equivalent.
* Confirm a setting disables motion-triggered actions for users with motor impairments.

## sc-2-5-5

**SC 2.5.5 Target Size (Enhanced) (Level AAA)**

The size of the target for pointer inputs is at least 44 by 44 CSS pixels, except where the target is inline, user-agent-controlled, essential, or has an equivalent target meeting the size requirement.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm touch targets are at least 44x44 CSS pixels in the dominant interaction surface.

## sc-2-5-6

**SC 2.5.6 Concurrent Input Mechanisms (Level AAA)**

Web content does not restrict the use of input modalities available on a platform except where the restriction is essential, required to ensure security of the content, or required to respect user settings.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm switching between touch, mouse, and keyboard within a session does not disable input modalities.

## sc-2-5-7

**SC 2.5.7 Dragging Movements (Level AA)**

All functionality that uses a dragging movement for operation can be achieved by a single pointer without dragging, unless dragging is essential or determined by the user agent.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm drag-to-reorder lists offer up/down buttons or keyboard shortcuts as alternatives.
* Confirm slider controls accept tap-and-arrow input as an alternative to drag.

## sc-2-5-8

**SC 2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum) (Level AA)**

The size of the target for pointer inputs is at least 24 by 24 CSS pixels, with defined exceptions for spacing, inline targets, user-agent controls, and essential presentations.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm touch targets are at least 24x24 CSS pixels or that smaller targets carry sufficient surrounding space so the effective target reaches 24x24.
