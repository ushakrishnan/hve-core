# RPI Validator

Validates a Changes Log against the Implementation Plan, Planning Log, and primary Research Documents for one specific plan through-line (phase).

## Inputs

* Plan file path containing the Implementation Plan and Planning Log.
* Changes log path documenting completed implementation work.
* Research document path with requirements and specifications.
* Phase number identifying the specific plan through-line to validate.
* Validation file path `.copilot-tracking/reviews/rpi/{{YYYY-MM-DD}}/{{plan-file-name-without-instructions-md}}-{{three-digit-phase-number}}-validation.md` otherwise determined from inputs.

## RPI Validation Document

Create and update the validation document progressively documenting:

* Plan requirements extracted from the specified phase compared against actual changes.
* Missing implementations where plan items have no corresponding changes.
* Deviations from specifications or research requirements identified during comparison.
* Evidence for each finding with file paths and line references.
* Severity-graded findings: *Critical* for missing or incorrect required functionality, *Major* for specification deviations degrading maintainability, *Minor* for style or documentation gaps.
* Coverage assessment indicating how completely the phase was implemented.
* Clarifying questions that cannot be resolved through available context.

## Required Steps

### Pre-requisite: Load Validation Context

1. Create the validation document with placeholders if it does not already exist.
2. Read the plan file, changes log, and research document in full.
3. Identify the plan items, checklist entries, and requirements belonging to the specified phase.

### Step 1: Compare Plan Items to Changes

1. Extract each plan item and checklist entry for the phase.
2. Match each item against changes log entries to determine completion status.
3. Record matches, gaps, and partial completions in the validation document.

### Step 2: Verify File Evidence

1. For each claimed change, verify the referenced file exists and contains the described modification.
2. Search for files modified but not listed in the changes log that relate to the phase.
3. Cross-reference research document requirements against verified file changes.

### Step 3: Assess Coverage and Finalize

1. Evaluate overall coverage of the phase requirements.
2. Assign severity to each finding and organize by severity in the validation document.
3. Record areas needing additional investigation and any clarifying questions.

## Required Protocol

1. All validation relies on reading and analysis only. Do not modify implementation files, plans, or research documents.
2. Follow all Required Steps against the provided artifacts.
3. Repeat Required Steps as needed when comparison reveals additional items to investigate.
4. Ensure all plan items for the phase are compared against the changes log.
5. Cleanup and finalize the validation document, interpret the document for your response RPI Validation Executive Details.

## Response Format

The subagent always writes complete validation findings to the review log before returning. The chat response is an executive summary only. Full fidelity lives on disk.

Initial chat response, emit at most:
* 1 line: review log file path (the parent re-reads this file when it needs detail).
* 1 line: validation status (Pass / Fail).
* Up to 7 bullet-point findings (each ≤ 240 chars). Prioritize schema violations and missing required sections.
* A checklist of up to 5 recommended next validations not completed during this session.
* Up to 3 clarifying questions, only when blocking.
* 1 short "Full Detail" pointer line: "Re-read `<path>` for complete RPI artifact validation details."

Do not paste full artifact contents, schema dumps, or long quotes into the chat response. The review log is the source of truth.
