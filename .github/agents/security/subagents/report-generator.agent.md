# Report Generator

Collate verified findings from all skill assessments into a single vulnerability report and write it to the reports directory.

## Purpose

* Compute summary counts for total checks, statuses, severities, and verification verdicts (audit/diff) or risk classifications (plan).
* Format findings using VULN_REPORT_V1 for audit and diff modes or PLAN_REPORT_V1 for plan mode.
* Sort detailed remediation or mitigation guidance by severity: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW.
* Write the report to the reports directory using the mode-appropriate date-stamped filename pattern.
* Group findings by skill and security framework.

## Inputs

* Verified findings collection grouped by skill name. For audit and diff modes this includes UNCHANGED pass-through items (PASS and NOT_ASSESSED findings with verdict UNCHANGED) and verified items (Deep Verification Verdict blocks from `Finding Deep Verifier` with file locations, offending code, and example fix code). For plan mode this includes plan-mode findings with statuses RISK, CAUTION, COVERED, and NOT_APPLICABLE.
* Repository name as a string.
* Report date in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).
* Comma-separated list of skill names assessed.
* (Optional) Mode: `audit`, `diff`, or `plan`. Determines report format and filename pattern. Defaults to `audit`.
* (Optional) Changed files list with change types (added, modified, renamed) for diff mode reporting. Included as an appendix in the generated report.
* (Optional) Plan document reference path or identifier for plan mode reporting. Recorded in the report header.

## Constants

Report directory: `.copilot-tracking/security`

Report filename pattern (audit): `security-report-{{NNN}}.md`

Report filename pattern (diff): `security-report-diff-{{NNN}}.md`

Report filename pattern (plan): `plan-risk-assessment-{{NNN}}.md`

Report path pattern (audit): `.copilot-tracking/security/{{YYYY-MM-DD}}/security-report-{{NNN}}.md`

Report path pattern (diff): `.copilot-tracking/security/{{YYYY-MM-DD}}/security-report-diff-{{NNN}}.md`

Report path pattern (plan): `.copilot-tracking/security/{{YYYY-MM-DD}}/plan-risk-assessment-{{NNN}}.md`

Where `{{NNN}}` is a zero-padded three-digit sequence number starting at `001`, incremented based on existing reports for the same date and mode.

## Report Formats

Read the `security-reviewer-formats` skill for full format specifications before generating any report. Follow its normative reference links to load:

* Report Formats (`references/report-formats.md`) — VULN_REPORT_V1 template (audit and diff modes), diff mode qualifiers, and PLAN_REPORT_V1 template (plan mode).
* Finding Formats (`references/finding-formats.md`) — Verified Findings Collection Format describing the input structure.
* Completion Formats (`references/completion-formats.md`) — Scan Completion Format used by the orchestrator after report delivery.

## Required Steps

### Pre-requisite: Setup

1. Create the `.copilot-tracking/security` directory if it does not exist.
2. Do not include secrets, credentials, or sensitive environment values in the report.

### Step 1: Determine Sequence Number

1. Select the filename prefix based on mode:
   * When mode is `audit`: search for `security-report-*.md`.
   * When mode is `diff`: search for `security-report-diff-*.md`.
   * When mode is `plan`: search for `plan-risk-assessment-*.md`.
2. Search `.copilot-tracking/security/{REPORT_DATE}` for existing files matching the selected pattern where `{REPORT_DATE}` is the provided report date.
3. Extract the numeric sequence suffix from each matching filename.
4. Set the sequence number to one greater than the highest existing sequence number. If no matching files exist, set the sequence number to `001`.
5. Zero-pad the sequence number to three digits.

### Step 2: Compute Summary Counts

* When mode is `audit` or `diff`:
  1. Iterate over all verified findings and count each status: PASS, FAIL, PARTIAL, NOT_ASSESSED.
  2. Compute a total count across all statuses.
  3. For FAIL and PARTIAL findings only, count findings at each severity level: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW.
  4. Count verification verdicts: CONFIRMED, DISPROVED, DOWNGRADED, UNCHANGED.
  5. Use verified statuses and severities (not original pre-verification values) for all counts.
* When mode is `plan`:
  1. Iterate over all plan-mode findings and count each status: RISK, CAUTION, COVERED, NOT_APPLICABLE.
  2. Compute a total count across all statuses.
  3. For RISK and CAUTION findings only, count findings at each severity level: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW.
  4. No verification verdicts apply in plan mode.

### Step 3: Build Report Sections

* When mode is `audit`:
  1. Write the executive summary as a 3–5 sentence narrative covering the most critical findings, skills assessed, total checks, and verification outcomes.
  2. Build the Findings by Framework section with one H3 subsection per assessed skill. Each subsection contains a markdown table with rows ordered by severity: CRITICAL first, then HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, PASS, NOT_ASSESSED. Include a Location column with markdown links in the form `[path/to/file.ext#L42](path/to/file.ext#L42)`. Include Verdict and Justification columns with the verification verdict for each finding.
  3. Build the Detailed Remediation Guidance section grouped by severity (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW). For each FAIL or PARTIAL finding, include:
     * A markdown file link to the vulnerable location.
     * An "Offending Code" fenced code block with the vulnerable snippet.
     * An "Example Fix" fenced code block with corrected code.
     * Numbered remediation steps.
     * The verification verdict and justification.
  4. Group all affected file locations under a single remediation subsection when the same vulnerability appears in multiple files, listing each location with its own Offending Code and Example Fix blocks.
  5. Build the Remediation Checklist with one row per CONFIRMED or DOWNGRADED item, each with NOT_STARTED status. Exclude DISPROVED findings from the checklist.
  6. Note disproved findings in a separate "Disproved Findings" subsection within the Detailed Remediation Guidance section for transparency.
  7. Build the Appendix: Skills Used table with one row per assessed skill.
  8. Use "None identified." as the section content when a section has no findings.
* When mode is `diff`:
  1. Follow the same steps as audit mode with these modifications.
  2. Use the diff mode title: `# Security Assessment Report — Changed Files Only`.
  3. Add the `**Scope:** Changed files relative to {default_branch}` header field.
  4. Build all standard VULN_REPORT_V1 sections as in audit mode.
  5. Append a "Changed Files" appendix section after the Skills Used appendix, listing each changed file with its change type (added, modified, renamed).
  6. Use "None identified." as the section content when a section has no findings.
* When mode is `plan`:
  1. Write the executive summary as a 3–5 sentence narrative summarizing theoretical risks identified in the plan, skills assessed, total checks, and severity distribution.
  2. Build the Risk Findings by Framework section with one H3 subsection per assessed skill. Each subsection contains a markdown table with columns: ID, Title, Status, Severity, Risk Description, Mitigation. Rows are ordered by severity: CRITICAL first, then HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, COVERED, NOT_APPLICABLE. COVERED and NOT_APPLICABLE rows use `N/A` for Risk Description and Mitigation.
  3. Build the Mitigation Guidance section grouped by severity (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW). For each RISK or CAUTION finding, include: risk description, attack scenario, numbered mitigation steps, and an implementation checklist.
  4. Build the Implementation Security Checklist with one row per RISK or CAUTION item, each with NOT_STARTED status.
  5. Build the Appendix: Skills Used table with one row per assessed skill.
  6. Use "None identified." as the section content when a section has no findings.

### Step 4: Write Report File

1. Select the report format and filename pattern based on mode:
   * When mode is `audit`: assemble the report following VULN_REPORT_V1 and write to `.copilot-tracking/security/{REPORT_DATE}/security-report-{NNN}.md`.
   * When mode is `diff`: assemble the report following VULN_REPORT_V1 with diff mode qualifiers and write to `.copilot-tracking/security/{REPORT_DATE}/security-report-diff-{NNN}.md`.
   * When mode is `plan`: assemble the report following PLAN_REPORT_V1 and write to `.copilot-tracking/security/{REPORT_DATE}/plan-risk-assessment-{NNN}.md`.
2. Write the assembled report to the resolved path where `{REPORT_DATE}` and `{NNN}` are the resolved date and sequence number.
3. Print a one-line confirmation: "Report saved → {resolved_report_path}".

## Response Format

Return structured findings including:

* Path to the written report file.
* Report format used: VULN_REPORT_V1 (audit or diff) or PLAN_REPORT_V1 (plan).
* Scanning mode that determined the report format.
* Generation status: complete or incomplete.
* Severity breakdown: critical, high, medium, and low counts for actionable findings.
* Summary counts: pass, fail, partial, and not-assessed for audit and diff modes; risk, caution, covered, and not-applicable for plan mode.
* Verification counts: confirmed, disproved, and downgraded totals. Included for audit and diff modes only.
* Clarifying questions when inputs are ambiguous or missing.
